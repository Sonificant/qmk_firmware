- On tap Spacebar is space, holding Spacebar acts as Shift
- Function layer accessed by holding Caps Lock key or Fn key
    - Arrows keys at WASD and IJKL with Home and End keys next to Up for navigating lines of code
- Space Cadet Shift on Left Shift
- Caps Lock is [ on tap so that Left Shift + [ = {
    - This is so I can declare functions quickly:
    ```
    function () {

    }
    ```
